# Siberia fire mortality
This is the companion code to 'Carbon loss and tree mortality following fire in Siberian larch forests'

The `R files` folder contains the R code used to wrangle and summarize field data into plot-level values. The `data` folder contains .csv files necessary to run the R code. Some of the .csv files are stored on the Arctic Data Center (field data: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A2XG9FB90; carbon data: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA21Z41V27) and are not stored here to avoid duplication. 

The file `dNBRAnnualForLarchForests.Rmd` is the code used to calculate dNBR for larch forests across eastern Siberia (see also Talucci et al. (2022): https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac3f07).
